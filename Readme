Programing Assignment 1
README File 

file Manifest:
- xed.cpp  
- Makefile
- README

compile instruction:
- go to the dirextory where the source files are located.
- Run the command 'make'.
- The executable 'xed' will be created. 

Operating instructions:
to run the program use the following 
./xed options <filename>

Options:
-b          Print binary format instead of hexadecimal
<filename>    the name of the file to view

Example:
./xed -b Makefile     that would print binary number. 
./xed makefile        that would print Hex number.

Novel/Significant Design Decisions:
- Implemented the xed program to read and print the content of a file in either hexadecimal or binary format based on user input.
- Utilized a Makefile for easier compilation and mangement of the project.
- The program uses command line argument to switch bewtween hex and binary modes demonstrating a simple but effective user interface for interface based application. 

Extra Features/Functionality:
Added support for printing the contents in binary in addition to hexadecimal format.
adjustable output: the program can be easily modified to change the number of columns in the output or to add additional output formats if needed.

List/description of all know defciencies or bugs
There is no error handiling for file reasd error that occur after the file has been successfully opened. 

Lessons Learned:
- Learned how to use edoras/linux for the firsr time. 
- Learned how to work around the terminal and got a better idea of how it works and how it operates.
- learned how to implemment file I/O operations in C++.
- Working with Makefile for managing compilation and linking of multiple source files.
- I understood more about bitwise operations for converting bytes to binary representation.
- the most imporant thing that i learned the hard way is that readying and processing binary files in C++ requires carful attention to data types and conversions between charcter and number representation.
